### Digit recognization using only numpy and pygame 
**Mnist dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/heeraldedhia/mnist-classifier-first-deep-learning-project/input?select=sample_submission.csv)**

Weights and biases after training are stored in `weights.npy` and `bias.npy` files to avoid wasting time during training.
If you want to train please empty these two files by using method in **DeepNeuralNetwork** class or just clear by yourself.
